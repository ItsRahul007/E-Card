Been using it for 10 days now and here's the summary:-

PROS:
-Camera__Nightography is insanely good. Beats iPhone14 and other top flagship phones by far. Portraits are a bliss for the eyes, feels like shot from DSLR.
-Performance__Super smooth performance with 8 gen 1. Can handle any mobile games flawlessly. Played BGMI and Asphalt 9 and there are hardly any frame drops even after an hour.
-Display__Display is too good. Peak brightness is enough and works brilliantly even during noon. Bezels are so slim it feels like holding just the screen.
-Design__In hand feel is Premium. Thought the s22 would be smaller but it actually fits perfectly and probably better than the s22+. Back glass looks super Premium.

CONS
-Battey__It's a big setback for this flagship Beast. Lasts 24hrs only in standby or if you pass half the time not using the phone. Barely lasts 12 hrs with a little bit of camera and ~1hr of gaming. Reason for a less star
-Heating__Heats a lot while playing games or recording videos. Would suggest doing these without a back cover for better performance.

OVERALL it's a steal @39999 just for the camera and performance. I genuinely prefer only these 2 and it doesn't bother me to charge the phone a couple of times or carry a powerbank so the cons are fine by me. But if you want your phone to last for a day or prefer bigger screen/storage there are better options in this price range.

Hope this helps ðŸ˜ƒ`;
